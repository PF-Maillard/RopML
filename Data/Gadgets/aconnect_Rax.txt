Dear Krishna,



I hope that you are doing well. From my point of view, the most important thing in cybersecurity is to have solid foundation is computer science: Algorithm, C programming, network, Operating system, Crypto system. Then, the next step will be to understand in which field you want to work: management of cybersecurity, reverse engineering, network architect. Accordingly, you can create a project in that specific field to improve your knowledge. If you want some small challenge in cybersecurity (it should not take all of your time) you have de website RootMe.



Regarding, certification and other, it is difficult to give any advice before to choose a specific field. Cybersecurity is a sector with a huge variety of profiles/jobs.

Regards,
